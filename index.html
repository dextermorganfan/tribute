            Patrick Bateman is the titular main protagonist of Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 controversial novel American Psycho and its film and stage adaptations, as well as a posthumous antagonist in the metafictional mock memoir Lunar Park and the posthumous overarching antagonist in the non-canon sequel of the same name.
            He is a businessman in the 1980s who lives in Manhattan and works at Wall Street. The very image of a yuppie, he is obsessed with his health, cleanliness, appearance, money, and music collection; however, he has a darker side, as he is also a serial killer, rapist, cannibal, and necrophile.

In the audiobook, he is voiced by Pablo Schreiber, who also played William Lewis in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Pornstache in Orange is the New Black.
